=====================
Prototype Volumes CLI
=====================

Flocker includes a powerful volumes API.
However it does not yet include a native CLI.

This prototype demonstrates such a CLI, which has simple commands for listing nodes, creating volumes, and moving them around.
This can be used in conjunction with the Flocker Docker plugin.
