=============
Labs Projects
=============

This page lists some experimental projects which, by their nature, are developed to less rigorous quality and testing standards than the mainline Flocker distribution.

In other words, this is cool stuff that may or may not work.
It is not built with production-readiness in mind.

However, if you like one of these projects please let us know.
We intend to promote popular projects to be fully supported.

We're working on a bunch of stuff, but this is the main picture:

* managing volumes (CLI/GUI)
* using from containers (plugins)
* other integrations
