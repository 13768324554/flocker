Installer
=========

This document guides you through setting up a Flocker cluster and gives the simplest example of deploying and moving around some stateful containers.

Key points
==========

* Flocker is a clustered container data volume manager.
  This means it runs on a cluster (a group) of machines, and connects containers to data volumes so that containers which store data, such as databases, keep their data as they move around the cluster.
* Flocker is installed on servers, which you must provision, for example on cloud infrastructure.
* It works with other container tools, such as Swarm, Compose and Mesos/Marathon.

Architecture
============

This diagram shows you what you are about to set up.

.. image:: install-architecture.png

.. Source file is at "Engineering/Labs/flocker architecture" https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3gop2KayxkVbmNBR2Jrbk0zYmM

* Installer runs in a Docker container on your local machine.
* You provision the servers yourself, then write a ``cluster.yml`` in your cluster directory containing the addresses of the servers.
* You run the installer on the ``cluster.yml``.
* Installer creates certificates for you, saves them in your cluster directory, installs Flocker and certificates on servers, and starts Flocker.
* You can now interact with your Flocker cluster using the Flocker CLI (included in same container as installer).

.. _labs-supported-configurations:

Supported Configurations
========================

The Installer can be used in the following configurations.

* **Supported configurations**

  * Ubuntu 14.04 on AWS with EBS backend
  * Ubuntu 14.04 on Rackspace with OpenStack backend
  * Ubuntu 14.04 on private OpenStack cloud with OpenStack backend

* **Experimental configurations**

  * CoreOS on AWS with EBS backend
  * Ubuntu 14.04 on any infrastructure with ZFS backend

Other configurations may work, but have not been tested.

.. _labs-installing-unofficial-flocker-tools:

Installing the Installer
========================

First we install the installer on your workstation.
This will work on Linux or OS X machines with Docker installed.

* If you don't have Docker installed, install it now (`Mac <https://docs.docker.com/mac/started/>`_, `Linux <https://docs.docker.com/linux/started/>`_).
* Then install the installer:

  .. prompt:: bash $

      curl -sSL https://get.flocker.io/ | sudo sh

  This installer is a tiny script which puts some wrapper scripts (around ``docker run`` commands) into your ``/usr/local/bin``.

* Now test one of the installed tools:

  .. prompt:: bash $

      uft-flocker-ca --version

  This should return something like ``1.2.0``, showing you which version of the Flocker Client is installed.

.. _labs-installer-certs-directory:

Make a local directory for your cluster files
=============================================

The tools will create some configuration files and certificate files for your cluster.
It is convenient to keep these in a directory, so let's make a directory on your workstation like this:

.. prompt:: bash $

    mkdir -p ~/clusters/test
    cd ~/clusters/test

Later on we'll put some files in this directory.

Get some nodes
==============

So now let's use the tools we've just installed to deploy and configure a Flocker cluster.

Choose one of the :ref:`supported configurations <labs-supported-configurations>` above and provision some nodes.

.. note::
    If using CoreOS on AWS, you can use `this CloudFormation template <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClusterHQ/flocker-coreos/master/coreos-stable-hvm.template>`_ to deploy an appropriate CoreOS cluster.
    Right click and save the link, then upload it to `CloudFormation <https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks?filter=active>`_.

Make sure you create the servers a reasonable amount of disk space (50GB+), since Docker images will be stored on the VM root disk itself.

Choose a node to be the control node.
It's OK for the control node to also be an agent node.

.. note::
    On AWS, you also need to add a firewall rule allowing traffic for TCP port 4523 and 4524, plus any ports you want to access (the demo later uses port 80).
    If you're using the CoreOS CloudFormation template, this is already done for you.

Create a cluster.yml
====================

Run the following command in your ``~/clusters/test`` directory you made earlier:

.. prompt:: bash $

    cd ~/clusters/test
    uft-flocker-sample-files

This will create some sample configuration files that correspond to the backend Flocker will use - base your ``cluster.yml`` on one of these files:

* AWS EBS: ``cluster.yml.ebs.sample``
* OpenStack (including Rackspace): ``cluster.yml.openstack.sample``
* ZFS (local storage): ``cluster.yml.zfs.sample``

.. warning::
    Note that ZFS support is experimental, and should not be used for production workloads.

Choose the one that's appropriate for you, and then customize it with your choice of text editor.
For example:

.. prompt:: bash $

    mv cluster.yml.ebs.sample cluster.yml
    vim cluster.yml # customize for your cluster

.. note::

    You need a private key which can log into the machines - you must configure the absolute location of this key in the ``private_key_path`` of ``cluster.yml``.

If using AWS, you need to copy the highlighted information below into your ``cluster.yml``:

.. image:: coreos-aws.png


Install Flocker
===============

From the directory where your ``cluster.yml`` file is now, run the following command:

.. prompt:: bash $

    uft-flocker-install cluster.yml

This will install the OS packages on your nodes required to run Flocker.
Flocker is not ready to run yet, we still need to do some certificate management.

Configure Certificates
======================

From the directory where your ``cluster.yml`` file is now, run the following command:

.. prompt:: bash $

    uft-flocker-config cluster.yml

This will configure certificates, push them to your nodes, and set up firewall rules for the control service.

Install Flocker Docker plugin
=============================

The Flocker Docker plugin allows you to use Flocker directly from the Docker CLI.

From the directory where your ``cluster.yml`` file is now, run the following command:

.. prompt:: bash $

    uft-flocker-plugin-install cluster.yml

Check that Flocker cluster is active
====================================

Try the Flocker CLI to check that all your nodes came up:

.. prompt:: bash $

    uft-flocker-volumes list-nodes
    uft-flocker-volumes list

You can see that there are no volumes yet.

Deploy and migrate a stateful app
=================================

Now you will deploy a highly sophisticated stateful app to test out Flocker.
In this example, ``demo`` is the name of the Flocker volume being created, which will map onto the Flocker volume being created.

.. prompt:: bash $

    NODE1="<node 1 public IP>"
    NODE2="<node 2 public IP>"
    KEY="<path on your machine to your .pem file>"
    DOCKER="docker" # change this to "/root/bin/docker" on CoreOS
    ssh -i $KEY root@$NODE1 $DOCKER run -d -v demo:/data --volume-driver=flocker --name=redis redis:latest
    ssh -i $KEY root@$NODE1 $DOCKER run -d -e USE_REDIS_HOST=redis --link redis:redis -p 80:80 --name=app binocarlos/moby-counter:latest
    uft-flocker-volumes list

This may take up to a minute since Flocker is provisioning and attaching an volume from the storage backend for the Flocker ``demo`` volume.
At the end you should see the volume created and attached to the first node.

Now visit http://``<node 1 public IP>``/ and click around to add some Moby Docks to the screen.
Now let's stop the containers, then start the stateful app on another node in the cluster.

.. prompt:: bash $

    ssh -i $KEY root@$NODE1 $DOCKER rm -f app
    ssh -i $KEY root@$NODE1 $DOCKER rm -f redis
    ssh -i $KEY root@$NODE2 $DOCKER run -d -v demo:/data --volume-driver=flocker --name=redis redis:latest
    ssh -i $KEY root@$NODE2 $DOCKER run -d -e USE_REDIS_HOST=redis --link redis:redis -p 80:80 --name=app binocarlos/moby-counter:latest
    uft-flocker-volumes list

At the end you should see the volume has moved to the second node.

This may take up to a minute since Flocker is ensuring the volume is on the second host before starting the container.

Now visit http://``<node 2 public IP>``/ and youâ€™ll see that the location of the Moby Docks has been preserved.
Nice.
