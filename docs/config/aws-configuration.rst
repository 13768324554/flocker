Amazon AWS / EBS Block Device Backend Configuration
===================================================

The AWS backend uses EBS volumes as the storage for datasets.
This backend can be used when Flocker dataset agents are run on EC2 instances.
The configuration item to use AWS should look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

   dataset:
       backend: "aws"
       region: "<region slug; for example, us-west-1>"
       zone: "<availability zone slug; for example, us-west-1a>"
       access_key_id: "<AWS API key identifier>"
       secret_access_key: "<Matching AWS API key>"

Make sure that the ``region`` and ``zone`` match each other and that both match the region and zone where the Flocker agent nodes run.
AWS must be able to attach volumes created in that availability zone to your Flocker nodes.
