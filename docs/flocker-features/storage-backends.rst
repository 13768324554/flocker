Flocker supports pluggable storage backends.
Any storage system that is able to present itself as a network-based block device can serve as the underlying storage for a Docker data volume managed by Flocker.
If the storage backend you are looking for is not currently supported by Flocker, you can consider :ref:`contributing it <build-flocker-driver>`.
