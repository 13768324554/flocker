About this integration
======================

Flocker integrates with the Docker Engine, Docker Swarm and/or Docker Compose via the Flocker Plugin for Docker.

The Flocker Plugin for Docker is a Docker volumes plugin.

It allows you to control Flocker directly from the Docker CLI or a Docker Compose file.

It also works in multi-host environments where you're using Docker Swarm.
