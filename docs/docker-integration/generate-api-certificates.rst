Generating an API Client Certificate

Next Step
=========

You now have an API client certificate.
The Docker integration requires an API client certificate for the :ref:`Flocker Plugin for Docker <plugin>`, as the plugin requires access to the Flocker REST API.
The next step is :ref:`generating an API client certificate for the Flocker plugin for Docker <generate-api-docker-plugin>`.

If you want to return to the menu for manually installing Flocker with Docker Swarm, click :ref:`here <installing-flocker-with-docker>`.
