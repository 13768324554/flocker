Introduction to Flocker
=======================

What is Flocker?
================

Flocker is an open-source Container Data Volume Manager for your Dockerized applications.

By providing tools for data migrations, Flocker gives ops teams the tools they need to run containerized stateful services like databases in production.

Unlike a Docker data volume which is tied to a single server, a Flocker data volume, called a dataset, is portable and can be used with any container, no matter where that container is running.

Flocker manages Docker containers and data volumes together.
When you use Flocker to manage your stateful microservice, your volumes will follow your containers when they move between different hosts in your cluster.

You can also use Flocker to manage only your volumes, while continuing to manage your containers however you choose.
To use Flocker to manage your volumes while tools like Docker, Docker Swarm or Mesos manage your containers, :ref:`use the Flocker plugin for Docker <docker-plugin>`.

   :alt: Migrating data: Native Docker versus Flocker.
         In native Docker, when a container moves, its data volume stays in place.
		 Database starts on a new server without any data.
		 When using Flocker, when a container moves, the data volume moves with it.
		 Your database gets to keep its data!

Flocker Basics
==============

Flocker works by exposing a simple :ref:`REST API<api>` on its Control Service.
The Flocker Control Service communicates with Flocker Agents running on each node in the cluster to carry out commands.

To interact with the Flocker API you can use the :ref:`Flocker CLI<cli>`, or access it directly in popular programming languages like Go, Python and Ruby.

With the Flocker API or CLI you can:

* Deploy a multi-container application to multiple hosts
* Move containers between hosts along with their volumes
* Attach and detach data volumes from containers as they change hosts
* Migrate local data volumes between servers (currently Experimental)

You can also use Flocker to manage only your volumes, while continuing to manage your containers however you choose.
To use Flocker to manage your volumes while tools like Docker, Docker Swarm or Mesos manage your containers, :ref:`use the Flocker plugin for Docker <docker-plugin>`.

Flocker supports block-based shared storage such as Amazon EBS, Rackspace Cloud Block Storage, and EMC ScaleIO, as well as local storage (currently Experimental using our ZFS storage backend) so you can choose the storage backend that is best for your application.
:ref:`View a complete list of supported storage backends <storage-backends>`.

.. image:: images/flocker-architecture.svg
   :alt: Flocker architecture with shared storage backend.
         The Flocker Control Service and containers hosts can run on a VM or bare metal servers.
		 The Flocker Agent running on each host speaks to the shared storage backend to create and moutn volumes to individual containers.

.. _docker-plugin:

The Flocker Plugin for Docker
=============================

The Flocker plugin for Docker allows Flocker to manage your data volumes while using other tools such as Docker, Docker Swarm, or Mesos to manage your containers.
The Flocker plugin for Docker is a `Docker volumes plugin`_, connecting Docker on a host directly to Flocker, where Flocker agents will be running on the same host and hooked up to the Flocker control service.

This diagram explains how the architecture of a Flocker cluster with the Docker plugin would look if the user is also using :ref:`Docker Swarm <labs-swarm>` and :ref:`Docker Compose <labs-compose>`:

.. image:: docker-plugin-platform-architecture.png

Note that in contrast to the normal :ref:`Flocker container-centric architecture <flocker-containers-architecture>`, in this architecture, the Flocker volume manager (control service + dataset agents) is **being controlled by Docker**, rather than Flocker container manager controlling Docker.
This allows for easier integration with other Docker ecosystem tools.

Also note that, as per this diagram, :ref:`Docker Swarm <labs-swarm>` and Flocker must be configured on the **same set of nodes**.

As a user of Docker, it means you can use Flocker directly via:

* The ``docker run -v name:path --volume-driver=flocker`` syntax.
* The ``VolumeDriver`` parameter on ``/containers/create`` in the Docker Remote API (set it to ``flocker``).

See the `Docker documentation on volume plugins`_.

The Flocker plugin for Docker depends on Docker 1.8 or later.

.. note::
    Note that you should either use the Flocker plugin for Docker to associate containers with volumes (the integration architecture described above), or you should use the :ref:`Flocker containers API <api>` and :ref:`flocker-deploy CLI <cli>`, but not both.

    They are distinct architectures.
    The integration approach allows Docker to control Flocker via the Flocker Dataset API.
    This allows Flocker to be used in conjunction with other ecosystem tools like :ref:`Docker Swarm <labs-swarm>` and :ref:`Docker Compose <labs-compose>`.

How It Works
------------

The Flocker Docker plugin means you can run containers with named volumes without worrying which server your data is on.

The plugin will create or move the volumes in place as necessary.

The Flocker Docker plugin operates on the ``name`` passed to Docker in the ``docker run`` command and associates it with a Flocker dataset with the same name (i.e. with metadata ``name=foo``).

There are three main cases which the plugin handles:

* If the volume does not exist at all on the Flocker cluster, it is created on the host which requested it.
* If the volume exists on a different host, it is moved in-place before the container is started.
* If the volume exists on the current host, the container is started straight away.

Multiple containers can use the same Flocker volume (by referencing the same volume name, or by using Docker's ``--volumes-from``) so long as they are running on the same host.

Also check out the `DockerCon Plugin Demos <https://plugins-demo-2015.github.io/>`_ site to see a joint project between ClusterHQ and Weaveworks.
This is the "ultimate integration demo" â€” a pre-built demo environment that includes Flocker, Weave, Swarm, Compose & Docker, all working together in harmony.

Flocker also has planned integrations with major orchestration tools such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and Apache Mesos.
More information on these integrations is :ref:`available in the Labs section <labs-projects>`.
